I have not seen him since November. \nAbout three weeks ago he stopped his Prednisone on his own because\nhe was gaining weight.  He does feel that his shoulders are\ndefinitely improved.  It is unclear what he is actually taking, but\nI think based on the color of his pills and the timing of the\nmedication that he continues taking his Atenolol for hypertension\nand 1 Hydroxychloroquine tablet.  He is concerned because of the\nrelatively recent onset of difficulties turning his head to the\nright.  When he does this, he will note that he feels as though he\nis going to pass out although this has not actually happened.  This\nonly occurs when he turns to the right and not to the left.  He has\nno visual changes otherwise and denies any headache or other\ncranial complaints.  \n \nOn examination today, BP 120/80.  He has no bruits over the\ncarotid.  He has no tenderness in this region either.  He has good\nperipheral pulses at the arms.  His joint examination is much\nimproved with better ROM of the shoulders and no peripheral joint\nsynovitis.  \n \nClinical Impression:\n \n#1:  Inflammatory arthritis - possibly RA - with response noted to\nHydroxychloroquine along with Prednisone.  He has stopped the\nPrednisone, and I would not restart it yet.  \n \n#2:  New onset of symptoms suspicious for right-sided carotid\ndisease.  Will arrange for carotid ultrasound studies.
